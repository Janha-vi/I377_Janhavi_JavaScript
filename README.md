### *by Janhavi Kherdekar I377*  

This web app **manages a user's to-do list** for the day. It is a **simple task manager** that allows users to **add, edit, and delete tasks**.  
Additionally, users can **mark a task as important** to highlight it for prioritization.  
Tasks are stored in **localStorage** to ensure persistence across page reloads.

1. **Add** task and task description  
2. **Delete** task  
3. **Edit** task  
4. **Mark task as completed**  
5. **Undo mark task as completed**  
6. **Mark task as important**  
7. **Toggle back to not important**  
8. **Filter tasks** by completed, pending, or important  



##  How It Works  
- Users enter a **task name** and **description**, then click **"Add Task"** to save it.  
- Tasks appear in a list with action buttons for **Complete, Important, Edit, and Delete**.
